# Rabobank Data Importer
Small App in React, that I've built for Rabobank as a test assignment.

# Assignment
Create a web application that is capable of importing the attached csv-file and visualize it in the front-end.

Keep in mind the following:
1. I should be able to select this file from my computer and see the results on screen
2. I should be able to filter the results based on minimal issue count
3. I should be able to see how many years old the person in question is
4. The application should display the same data when opened in another tab or another browser
5. The front-end should be built using Angular 1 or 2, or a webcomponent,or react, or ionic 
6. The back-end should be built using a recent Java version
7. Act as if this code is meant to be production code for the Rabobank
